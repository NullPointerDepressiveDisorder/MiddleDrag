      <description><![CDATA[Enhance mouse event handling and logging for improved drag performance (#69)

* Enhance mouse event handling and logging for improved drag performance

- Updated the MouseEventGenerator to track the last sent mouse position, preventing jumps from stale positions during drag operations.
- Implemented smoothing for mouse movement updates, allowing for more consistent and responsive drag actions.
- Enhanced logging to detect and report potential snap-back issues during horizontal drag movements, integrating with Sentry for telemetry.
- Modified AppDelegate to include session ID in startup logs for better tracking.
- Improved MultitouchManager to ensure proper handling of force clicks and drag states, preventing interference during active drags.
- Added setup and teardown methods in AnalyticsManagerTests to isolate test cases and ensure consistent state.

* Refactor mouse event handling to improve thread safety and logging

- Updated MouseEventGenerator to read the current mouse position before acquiring a lock, enhancing thread safety during drag operations.
- Simplified telemetry logging by consolidating the guard statement, ensuring logs are only sent when telemetry is enabled.
- Retained the sendRelativeMouseMove function for potential future use while clarifying its purpose in comments.
